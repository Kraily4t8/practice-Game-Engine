# practice-Game-Engine
 practicing JS game engine

This project is intended as my practice for TCSS 491 Winter 2024 meant as a learning device for me (Thomas Tien) as I follow along my professor(Chris Marriot)'s video series explaining how to further modify the game shell to fit a JS coding game project

The game shell was happily modified from Googler Seth Ladd's "Bad Aliens" game and his Google IO talk in 2011

Status: In the middle, heading towards the end of winter break currently. May scale back development and practice as family events occur, only spending time on this project when convenience and time allows

DevGoal: Get a strong understanding of gameshell and be able to comfortably manipulate elements to fit my needs... As a game designer, as a tool designer, as simulation designer. Hopes to build my foundational understanding of project work as an individual

GameGoal: Simple movement and interaction with objects that set events to playout
